// This is an example file that would be minified by the HTML5 Boilerplate Ant Build Script.

var someVar = "hello world";

/*

Notice in index.html how this script is referenced between the comments: 

  <!-- scripts concatenated and minified via build script -->

  <!-- end scripts -->
  
HTML5 Boilerplate looks for these and concatenates and minifies anything between, 
replacing the link to the new, optimized file when finished.
